# Simulated Annealing for the TSP

GraphResults.java provides some examples to view the results of simulated annealing on the TSP. It takes into account possible wait times at the nodes.

In the special case where speed = 1 and all wait times at every node are 0, then this becomes the classic TSP problem where we minimize the distance.
